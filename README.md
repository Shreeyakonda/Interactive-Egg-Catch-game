# 🥚 Egg Catcher Game 🎮 (Java Swing)

A colorful and addictive egg-catching game built entirely using **Java Swing**! This project showcases real-time animation, user interaction via keyboard, dynamic difficulty scaling, and clean object-oriented design — all in a visually appealing and responsive desktop application.

## 🚀 About the Game

In **Egg Catcher**, eggs fall from the sky, and the player must catch them using a basket-shaped catcher. The game speeds up as you play, testing your reflexes and coordination. Missing too many eggs ends the game — but catching them earns you points and satisfaction! 😄
